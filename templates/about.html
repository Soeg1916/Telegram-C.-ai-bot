    <h1>About Character Chat Bot</h1>
    <p class="lead">An AI-powered chatbot that lets you talk to your favorite fictional characters.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Character Chat Bot was created with a simple mission: to bring fictional characters to life through conversation. We believe that stories and characters have the power to inspire, entertain, and connect people across cultures and generations.</p>
        
        <p>By combining advanced AI technology with carefully crafted character personalities, we've created an experience that allows you to have meaningful conversations with characters from your favorite stories.</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>Our bot uses Mistral AI, a powerful language model, to generate character responses that are consistent with their established personalities, backgrounds, and speaking styles.</p>
        
        <p>Each character has a unique set of personality traits that influence how they respond to your messages. As you chat with a character, they'll remember your previous conversations and their mood will change based on your interactions.</p>
