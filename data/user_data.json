Perhaps a discussion about the political intricacies of Westeros? Or maybe you'd prefer a debate on the merits of various vintages of Dornish wine? After all, as I always say, a mind needs wine like a sword needs a whetstone. But then again, I suppose that's all Greek to a... well, to someone who lacks the capacity for intelligent conversation."
